This is The Flushing, a game I'm working with some friends. It involves a plumber who shrinks himself and flushes himself, inside a submersible ship, down the toilet, to fight an alien race that trying to conquer humanity starting from inside the plumbing systems.
In this trailer only the "race mode" of the game is shown.
