Here's a sneak-peek at a Game I've just started working on, I'm calling it Starminer. You play as a pilot of a ship collecting energy from these energy orbs that emerge in random points in space. Depending on the colour of the orbs, you'll need to pass by them more or less times to collect all the energy they can provide, at which point they disappear. In each area you need to collect the energy and avoid being shot by the enemies shooting at you.
